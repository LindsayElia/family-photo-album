#### Demo the App

You can try out the application at [www.everyonesphotos.com](http://everyonesphotos.com/). It is currently in development.

#### Project Description

_Everyone's Photos_ is an online family photo album, with all photos on a single page, contributed by many family members, and easily accessible to anyone with the link to the photo album (publicly available).

_Everyone's Photos_ makes it easier for families to share digital photos with the whole family. The purpose is for family members who do not use online tools frequently to be able to view family photos easily. 

Current problems with available tools for photo sharing include:

- a large family may use many tools and not everyone in the family will want to use the same tools
- it can be complicated for people who do not use any online tools to navigate these various photo sharing options.

There are 3 kinds of users:

- Account Owner - this is the family member who creates an account and decides what the family-specific URL will be. This family member invites others to join their _Family Group_.
- Contributors - these are all family members, invited by the Account Owner, that can connect this application to photo sharing tools that they already use, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Flickr.
- Public access / easy access - this is for the family member who does not use computers often, is not familiar with how to use photo sharing tools online, is not comfortable with email services, or may have trouble using any application that requires a login to use. The publicly accessible _Family Album_ page will be a simple browser page that can be bookmarked on an ipad so that an ipad user can access it as though it were a simple ipad app.
