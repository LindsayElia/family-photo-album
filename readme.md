#### High-level description of this project: what question or problem does this project address?

This is an online family photo album, with all photos on a single page, contributed by many family members, and easily accessible to anyone with the link to the photo album (publicly available).

This project will make it easier for families to share digital photos with the whole family. The purpose is for family members who do not use online tools frequently to be able to view family photos easily. 

Current problems with available tools for photo sharing inlude:

- a large family may use many tools and not everyone in the family will want to use the same tools
- photo storage can be limited for free users, so old photos must be deleted before new photos can be added
- it can be too complicated for people who do not use any online tools to navigate these various photo sharing options.

There will be 3 kinds of users:

- Account Owner - this is the family member who creates an account and decides what the family-specific URL will be.
- Contributors - these are all family members, invited by the Account Owner, that can connect this application to other online photo sharing tools that they already use, such as Facebook, Instagram, Shutterfly, Snapfish, Google Plus, Dropbox, etc.
- Public access / easy access - this is for the family member who does not use computers often, and/or is not familiar with how to use photo sharing tools online, email, may have trouble using any application that requires a login to use. The publicly accessible family album page will be a simple browser page that can be bookmarked on an ipad so that the ipad user can access it as though it were an ipad app.

There may also be an admin view that I would have access to if there is enough time to add one.
